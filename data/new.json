    "text": "Shibata Zeshin was one of the few artists widely recognized for his paintings on silk and paper and his innovative mastery of lacquering techniques and design. Early in his life Zeshin was apprenticed to the lacquer workshop of Koma Kansai II (1766\u20131835), who produced lacquerware for the ruling elite, as well as the wealthy merchant class. Yet Zeshin left at 16 to study painting. Zeshin\u2019s mastery of both art forms is evident on this sliding door, with the lacquer skillfully fashioned to create a scene as evocative as an ink painting. The ducks are decorated in black and colored lacquers with gold and silver powders and shell inlays for the subtle iridescence of birds\u2019 feathers. Using the technique of direct lacquering (kiji nuri), wherein the lacquer design is applied directly to the substrate, Zeshin deftly utilizes the grain of the wood to guide the verticality of the composition, and gently evoke the rippling of water.",

According to the artist, the undulating movements of the bamboo suggest shimmering hot air rising from the ground. Tanioka began this basket from the square rim and then attached the curved culms with rattan. Instead of using a traditional weaving technique with split bamboo, Tanioka Shigeo took unsplit bamboo culms and bent them into the desired shape using a gas flame or by immersing them in hot water \u2013 the most difficult part of the construction process of this artwork. After molding, the pieces were trimmed to the required length; a technique called marutake kumimono. The bamboo is hōbichiku, smoked bamboo salvaged from houses built at least a century earlier. It was finished with wiped-lacquer (fuki-urushi), a process where lacquer is repeatedly applied and the excess wiped off, thus enhancing the appearance of the natural grain. For forms like this, he makes detailed drawings to ensure the accuracy of the dimensions of the pieces.",

However, if the deceased had powerfully obsessive emotions in this life, her soul would remain in the world of the living as a ghost, unable to proceed to the next world until finding release from her obsessions. Ghosts are almost always female and are commonly portrayed as legless figures wearing white robes used for corpses and with long, disheveled hair and horrific facial expressions.\r\n\r\nPainters of such images rarely signed their works, which were usually stored in Buddhist temples, believed to be the best place to secure ghostly imagery. Summer was seen as the best time to view such paintings\u2014when Kabuki theaters staged ghost plays, the pictures provided viewers with a welcoming chill in the hot, humid months.\r\n\r\n",

Raku tea bowls are formed by hand, so each bowl is a unique creation meant to conform to the user\u2019s grip. As lacquer is a far less pliable substance than clay, Unryūan mimicked the contoured shape of the ceramic bowl by carving out the wooden core of the bowl, and using the dry lacquer technique (kanshitsu) to give the bowl its subtle form. Dry lacquer involves soaking a piece of cloth in lacquer, then molding it over the substrate as desired. To give the bowl its final mottled, glaze-like appearance, the artist used kawari-nuri, a technique that uses dry, ground up dustings of lacquer to create the speckled surface of the bowl.",

Though she sits in a blue tent of the sort erected in Japanese parks today by the homeless, Komachi retains an ethereal beauty, clothed in layers of blankets or perhaps the robes of the Heian court. A deferential reference to Japanese culture, the work is also a critique of Japanese disregard for the country\u2019s growing homeless population.",

    "text": "The Tale of Genji (Genji monogatari) is Japan\u2019s most famous work of literature and is thought to be the world\u2019s first novel. Written in the 11th century by the court lady Murasaki Shikibu (c. 973\u2013c. 1014 or 1025), it chronicles the fictional Prince Genji and his descendants, focusing on the aristocratic life and spirit of the times. Depictions of scenes from the story have been found on decorative elements within the homes of the educated and elite. \r\n\r\nChapter 34: New Herbs I (Wakana) \r\nPrince Genji\u2019s nephew, Kashiwagi, is depicted here playing kemari, a courtly version of soccer, together with Yūgiri, Genji\u2019s son, and some other friends under blooming cherry trees, the symbol of spring. During this game Kashiwagi and Yūgiri both catch a glimpse of Onna San no Miya, Genji\u2019s young wife, when a Chinese cat lifts the curtain to her quarters. Such exposure was very compromising for a high ranking lady, as she was not supposed to be seen by males outside her immediate family at all. After this incident Kashiwagi falls passionately in love with her and a fatal affair ensues.\r\n\r\nChapter 17: The Picture Competition (E-awase)\r\nThe scene in the lower right corner shows Genji and his pupil and later wife Murasaki commenting on old and new pictures with several courtiers. As the picture competition continues, Genji\u2019s picture diary from his exile in Suma is praised.\r\n\r\nChapter 9: Heartvine (Aoi)\r\nIn this episode, the Kamō-River ceremony, an important Shinto ritual, is held and the courtiers swarm out in their carriages to watch the spectacle. Genji\u2019s pregnant consort, Lady Aoi, decides to join the ceremony at the last minute. While pushing their way into the festival scene her attendants seriously damage another carriage, which turns out to belong to Rokujō, who was Genji\u2019s lover.\r\n\r\nChapter 13: Akashi\r\nDuring Genji\u2019s exile in Akashi, the governor of Akashi encourages him to make advances to his daughter, as he wishes to raise his status through an advantageous marriage. The relationship is not greatly successful because of ",

Five additional scenes in the right screen take place in late spring and early summer, while autumn grasses and maple leaves announce the arrival of fall in the far right panels of the left screen. Wintry scenes from chapters 6 and 51 are depicted at far left, where trees and rooftops are blanketed in snow.",

At first glance their faces look similar, but Jōryū juxtaposes three types of femininity\u2014a prostitute holding folded tissue paper, a geisha (entertainer) with a fan, and a city girl. Each one represents a different type of charm through her gesture and expression.\r\n\r\nMihata Jōryū was active in Kyoto during the 1830s, and his paintings of beauties with clear-cut features and luxuriously designed kimonos became very fashionable, even in Edo (present-day Tokyo). By the 1830s many artists had come to follow Jōryū\u2019s style, but little is known about the artist himself. Even his name is somewhat unclear, because he uses seals that read \u201cJōryū\u201d and others reading \u201cJōryō.\u201d His family name is believed to be Mihata, but that also is uncertain, for he used the surname Yokoyama on at least one extant painting.\r\n\r\n",

The prominence of the mizusashi requires that the aesthetics of the piece be harmonious with the rest of the utensils. Negoro wares were favored by tea practitioners in the late 16th century, so the simple red lacquer coating of the piece may reference this predilection. However, the shiny, bright hue of this mizusashi is rather antithetical to the aged, well-worn look that negoro wares are prized for, and the clean lines and simple metallic embellishments speak to a modern aesthetic, dating this to sometime in the first half of the 20th century.",

The design is applied to the wood base with the kiji nuri (direct lacquer) technique, wherein a coat of translucent lacquer is spread on the wood to prevent the lacquer design from seeping into the porous surface of the wood, and then the decorative lacquer coats are applied. The leaves of the maple are executed in red lacquer, faux-pewter, and mother-of-pearl inlays, many of which have partially flaked away.",

No other works are known by the mysterious Kunitsugu, and until recently it was believed that this painting dated to the 1820s. However, the discovery of the similar-looking print by Kuniyoshi from around 1848 suggests differently. The painting cannot have been done prior to the print as Kuniyoshi was a successful and well-known artist who would not have copied a work by an unknown painter. It seems plausible then that Kunitsugu created the painting after Kuniyoshi's print, perhaps on commission.",

Taiga assimilated and modified Chinese painting modes like his predecessors had, but he also synthesized what he learned, experimenting with compositional formulas and brushwork to create new and viable styles that were uniquely Japanese. With Taiga, Japanese Nanga painting reached maturity during the third quarter of the 1700s. \r\nFor this painting he used a relatively dry brush to paint a landscape in the lower right corner in a style related to that of the Chinese painter Ni Zan (1306\u201374). It shows a scholar and servants in a boat floating on a river between a foreground of rocky outcroppings and a grove of gangly trees and mountains in the distance. The rest of the scroll is filled with the three hundred Chinese characters that make up the entire text of the short Buddhist scripture commonly known as the Heart Sutra. \r\n",

    "text": "On this single six-panel screen, the flowers of the four seasons bloom in confused disarray. The rightmost panel starts with spring flowers: dandelions, violets, nanohana, white camellias, then plum. At about the center of the screen, irises, hydrangea, hollyhocks, peonies, hibiscus, and morning glories represent summer. The leftmost panel shows autumn and winter with chrysanthemums, bush clover, and arrowroot, thus including and gathering together representative flowers of each of the four seasons.\r\nMuch is unclear about the life of Saito_ Ippo, but it is thought that he was the pupil of Sakai O_ho (1808-41), the adopted son of Sakai Ho_itsu, and was an official at the Asakusa Temple in Edo. Few works by Ippo survive and the others currently known are almost exclusively screens with mounted fan paintings. Nonetheless, the outlines of the flowers and plants in this work are very carefully executed and the technique of precisely layering colors and gold pigment shows that the artist had considerable talent and drew from the Edo Rinpa tradition, making this a valuable work by Ippo.

    "text": "Two lively squirrels add interest, charm, and a touch of humor to a classic subject of ink painting, bamboo. While squirrels have no specific symbolic meaning in Japanese art, they appeared as decorative motifs in netsuke, ornamental toggles used to attach personal items to the sash. Paired with bamboo shoots, the courting squirrels allude to the arrival of spring; or perhaps, given the graceful flexibility of bamboo, are a parable of successful marriage.\r\n\r\nMochizuki Gyokusen was the first generation of a lineage of artists bearing the Mochizuki name. He began his career creating designs for <I> inrō<\/I> (tiered boxes worn attached to the sash) in lacquer (<I>maki-e <\/I>); perhaps this foundation in the decorative arts inspired the choice of subject for this painting. Gyokusen later studied Tosa and Kanō styles of painting under Tosa Mitsunari (1646\u20131710) and Yamaguchi Sekkei (1612\u20131669) respectively.",

    "text": "In the 1500s and 1600s Japanese painters created works inspired by the Chinese Zen monk-painter Muqi Fachang (active c. 1210\u2013after 1269). Sometimes they painted in his style, and other times they painted subjects associated specifically with him. This painting does both: the subject matter and the painting style hearken back to Muqi. Japan\u2019s military rulers owned a painting of sparrows on bamboo by Muqi. This painting became well known because it was copied and distributed widely. Japanese people came to associate this subject with Muqi. \r\n\r\nHere, a Japanese artist shows a family of sparrows on a corkscrewing shoot of bamboo. Four chicks are huddled near the ground, while their mother watches over them from above. The birds are all painted without any outlines; instead, their bodies are described using areas of diluted ink-wash on top of which small brushstrokes indicate the birds\u2019 eyes, beaks, feathers, etc. This technique, known in China and Japan as \u201cboneless\u201d (i.e., without contour lines), was associated in Japan with Muqi, whose works helped introduced this technique to Japan.\r\n",

He is seen walking below a plum tree and staring into the distance as a young attendant draws up behind him, carrying the branch of a plum tree collected earlier. Lin Hejing was renowned for his love of the plum tree, a first sign of spring that oftentimes blossoms when snow is still falling. \r\n\r\nKano Gyokuraku was affiliated with the preeminent Kano house of painters, whose artists dominated the Japanese painting scene for centuries beginning in the late 1500s. Although the Kano house was headquartered in Kyoto, the capital city, when Gyokuraku was active he led a regional branch of the house that was situated in Odawara, a castle town in eastern Japan.\r\n",

    "text": "This two-panel screen depicts the Daoist immortals, Gama Sennin (Chin. Liu Hai) and Tekkai Sennin (Chin. Li Tieguai). The two were often paired in Japanese and Chinese art because of their corresponding supernatural powers. Depicted on the right is Gama Sennin, known literally as the \u2018toad hermit,\u2019 a character based on the historical civil servant and alchemist Liu Hai of 10th century China. Various accounts associate Gama with a large, three-legged toad by which he can be identified. Gama was thought to be able to release his spirit from his body, metamorphose, and fly with the aid of his magical companion. Chinese prototypes of this theme sometimes represent the immortal sitting on or resting his foot on the animal and holding a string of gold coins, with which he is supposed to have lured the toad from its hiding place in a well. Here, however, Kuroda Ryōzan has depicted the relationship between his subjects as one of affection rather than of conquest. Gama\u2019s flattened head, broad nose, and wide grin convey an eccentric character and otherworldly nature. \r\n\r\nTekkai Sennin is the Japanese adaptation of one of the Eight Immortals (Baxian), an assemblage of Daoist and/or folk deities. He was thought to be capable of leaving his body, sometimes traveling for extended periods. On one occasion, he asked a disciple to watch over his body and instructed him to burn it if his spirit did not return in seven days. On the sixth day, however, the disciple\u2019s mother died, so he burned his master\u2019s body and went home. Returning on the seventh day, Tekkai\u2019s spirit found his body gone, leaving him no choice but to adopt the corpse of an emaciated beggar that he found beside the road. Like Gama Sennin, he is associated with medicine, and is traditionally represented with a gourd that signifies his ability to transcend the body and to offer healing. While usually appearing as a decrepit figure after his physical transformation, here Ryōzan has chosen to depict Tekkai as he exhales his spirit from his mouth.\r\n\r\nKuroda Ryōzan was a",

A dusting of snow\u2014delicately painted using gofun, a white pigment made of ground oyster shells\u2014has fallen on the tree and chrysanthemums in bloom below.  \r\n\r\nLittle is known about the artist, who affixed his large red seal reading \"Geiai\" at upper left. Probably active in Kyoto at the end of the 1400s, Geiai\u2019s extant body of work reveals his fluency in several different styles of Chinese bird-and-flower painting introduced to Japan in the 1300s and 1400s. The unique composition (with all the motifs gathered at left), heavy contour lines, and distinctive texturing of the rocks suggest that Geiai took as his model a painting by a member of the Zhe school, a group of painters that flourished in China\u2019s Zhejiang region during the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) and many of whose paintings were exported to Japan.   \r\n",

Officially \u201cDeer Garden Temple\u201d (Rokuonji), the temple is named after its famous golden pavilion, one of Kyoto\u2019s most iconic sights. However, the pavilion seen today is a reconstruction, as the original building was burnt down by a novice monk in 1950.\r\n\r\nBeing an ardent traveler, Hiroshi often included non-Japanese subjects in his work, such as the Swiss Alps, India, or Korea. His skill at transferring the subtle color gradations of painting to woodblock prints, and conveying the constant change stirred up by nature, vastly contributed to the renaissance of woodblock prints in the early 20th century.",

    "text": "The poem <I>Song of Everlasting Sorrow<\/I> (<I>Changhen ge<\/I>), by Chinese poet Bai Juyi\u2019s (772\u2013846), tells the story of Emperor Xuanzong (685\u2013762; reigned as Emperor Minghuang) and his breathtakingly beautiful favorite concubine Yang Guifei (719\u2013756). This painting shows Guifei dancing at right in front of the emperor and several attendants. A rebellion in 755 forced the emperor to flee the capital, and angry imperial guards\u2014believing that Yang Guifei was responsible for Xuanzong\u2019s neglect of state affairs\u2014demanded her execution and put her to death. Xuanzong abdicated the throne shortly thereafter, triggering the decline of the dynasty. This tragic love affair became a popular subject among Kano painters like Kano Naganobu (1577\u20131654), who moved his branch of the Kano House to the capital, Edo (present-day Tokyo), in 1605 and became the first Kano painter to serve as painter-in-attendance to the Tokugawa shoguns.",

    "text": "This writing box is richly decorated with taka maki-e and mother of pearl inlays, and taka maki-e and hira maki-e with kirigane flakes augmenting the background on the inner lid. Peonies and wisteria are both summer blooms, and the fertility of the season is portrayed in the lushness of the composition. Additionally, peonies are often associated with the scholarly class, making it an appropriate motif for a suzuribako, and their appearance on both the inner and outer lid creates continuity throughout the box. The decorative motif on the inside refers to the kabuki dance Kagamijishi, which interprets the story of a karashishi attempting to rid itself of insects in its mane with the dew of a peony blossom. While the design shows the lion playfully chasing the butterflies, rather than scratching them out of his mane, the elements depicted would have been easily recognizable to a contemporary viewer.",

    "text": "The road to Shu, the old name of Sichuan Province, was famous for its precarious passages along sheer cliffs. Parts of this road were no wider than a single person and had to be built out on poles from the face of the cliffs. Chinese poets like Li Bai (701\u2013762) composed poems on this hard to manage trail that leads up Mount Emei (Jap. Gabi). One of the Four Buddhist Sacred Mountains of China, Mount Emei is 10,167 ft. (3,099 m) tall.\r\nYokoi Kinkoku was a follower of Yosa Buson and imitated him even in his style of calligraphy. He painted in a rapid and spontaneous manner and was especially successful in capturing the vibrancy of mountains and rocks. Toward the end of his life he became a wandering Buddhist priest of the Jōdo (Pure Land) school. Irregularly and richly shaped, the mountains go high up in the painting. Travelers in the foreground are crossing a bridge and we see others at intervals on the slope that climbs up the mountains. Black ink dotting and live-ly outlines give the rocks a rich texture.",

    "text": "China claims to be the birth place of porcelain and the pale blue, <I>qingbai<\/I>, glazed porcelain is one of the oldest glazing methods that gained popularity in eleventh century Southern China. The combination of clay and glaze, characterized by the beautiful contrast of blue and white, is considered to be one of the landmarks of the rich history of Chinese porcelain.\r\nFukami extends this traditional medium to the realm of conceptual sculpture. He is well-known for his porcelain sculptures in abstract forms, but also won a number of prizes with wheel thrown works such as this. A sister piece of this work received the Special Prize at the Japan Fine Art Exhibition (Nitten) in 1984, and is in the collection of the National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto.",

The title <I>Shikishi moyō<\/I> 志来し模様 only phonetically refers to those cards, which were usually made of sturdy, sometimes colorfully dyed paper, but the characters imply a different meaning. Maybe the publisher chose the unusual characters for the title because he wanted to emphasize the creative process of designing. Volume one features 32 images, including two color prints in green and orange, while the remaining designs and the 30 images in volume two are depicted in monochrome ink woodblock print. The designs include images from nature imagery, such as waves and plant motifs, but also some abstract patterns.",

Tigers were a favorite subject for East Asian painters, and Korean paintings of tigers were highly influential in Japan, where painters took Korean examples as their models, especially during and after the 1600s. In fact, this painting itself has a long history in Japan. It has been handed down with a document written in 1863 attributing the painting to Tenshō Shūbun (active c. 1403\u201350), a highly celebrated medieval Japanese painter to whom many ink paintings in Japan were traditionally attributed. More likely, however, it was created by a Korean artist working in the 1600s before finding its way to Japan, where it remained until recently.",

Each plant is associated with a season (orchids with spring, bamboo with summer, chrysanthemum with autumn, and plum with winter) and a range of qualities that resonated with Confucian and Zen ideals. The orchid is associated with purity, loyalty, incorruptibility, and modesty and its long, tapered leaves and fine petals of the plant make it ideally suited to the play of ink and brush.",

    "text": "Covered boxes such as this are often used to serve the small cakes provided during tea gatherings to cut the bitter taste of the green tea powder. This kashibako, designed by Kamisaka Sekka, hints at the wabi aesthetic, which prizes naturalistic or imperfect objects. Though the box\u2019s smooth, round shape stands in direct contrast to the rustic ceramics favored by wabi style practitioners, the rough grain of the wood is retained on the outside of the piece. The exterior of the container is covered in a thin coat of clear lacquer, lending the natural wood a glossy finish, while the lid is coated in black lacquer with a design of gentians done in silver and gold maki-e.",

The New Chair emphasizes simple construction, functional form, and the trees that provided the wood\u2014American black walnut for the seat, legs, and top rail; hickory for the spindles. These characteristics are shared with the furniture of the early 1900s Arts and Crafts movement, seen in this gallery, as well as Scandinavian modern design. \r\n\r\nThe influence of Japanese furniture can be seen in the visible construction and open, modern forms. Nakashima traveled to Japan and studied with a Japanese craftsman while in an internment camp in America during World War II.\r\n",
