  "text": "As middlemen of the Atlantic trade from the 1500s onwards, the Kalabari were in close contact with Europeans and their two-dimensional images. It seems likely that prints and paintings inspired the tradition of funerary screens, which began around 1800. Reserved for the heads of powerful trading houses, they offered the spirits of the dead a place to regularly return, receive offerings, and follow the business. The large, central figure of the deceased is flanked by two attendants.",
