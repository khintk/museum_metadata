  "text": "This large head of the Buddha most likely comes from the wall of a cave temple. The idea of carving temples and monastic complexes into living rock comes from India, but it became a favorite type of religious building in China as well. Buddhist cave sanctuaries at Dunhuang, Yunkang, Longmen and Tianlongshan are famous for their associated sculpture. Often the back wall of a cave chapel was devoted to a large Buddha with flanking attendants. Carved during the Northern Qi dynasty (570-577) in a black limestone native to northern Honan, it is likely that this finely modeled head came from a rock temple in that region.",
