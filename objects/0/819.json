  "description": "Kia with four spread legs, inscribed. The decor of the body, S-shaped in profile, displays the usual elements of a bodied t'ao-t'ieh flanked by vertical dragons and, in the neck belt, beaked dragons with a band of rising blades filled with disolved cicada figures. The flanges on the body are low, narrow and unscored. Scores appear, instead, on the horns of the large t'ao-t'ieh and on parts of the antithetical beaked dragons appearing in a complicated arrangement on the outer surfaces of the legs. On the top of the handle is a t'ao-t'ieh with C-shaped horns, its mouth gaping over a finely-drawn cicada. The uprights, square at the base, with an incurving profile, are decorated with a spiral band, slender rising blades, and t'ao-t'ieh masks on the tops. Patina grey-green",

  "text": "Ritual bronze vessels had political and religious significance for the Shang people, who used them to worship ancestors in rituals. This vessel would have held wine during the ceremonies that typified elite Shang society. \r\n\r\n<P> Composite-animal masks, <I>taotie</I>, appear on the largest panel on each side of this exquisite <I>fangjia</I>, which also features stylized animals, as is typical of much Shang art. Distinguished by its square profile, this is among the rarest ritual vessels of the Bronze Age.",
