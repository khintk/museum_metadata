  "text": "This standing figure of a bodhisattva—a being who has forestalled its own passage to nirvana in order to guide others to salvation—represents a change in Buddhist art in China. It exhibits a new fashion for elaboration and ornament that emerged in the late 500s yet also retains the rigid frontality of earlier generations. Coiffed with an extravagantly decorated headdress, it wears a jeweled necklace with multiple charms and brooches, and strands of beads punctuated by larger jewels, jade pendants, and coral branches. The two inscriptions on the base, one dating from 570 and the other from 581, refer to a statue of Buddha Shakyamuni, not the current bodhisattva. This discrepancy suggests that the base was originally carved for a Buddha figure, and then used again for a later Buddha figure that was flanked by two bodhisattvas. Sometime afterward, the base was combined with this bodhisattva figure—the only surviving statue of the trinity. The characteristic knots of scarf above the figure’s ears confirm that it dates from the Sui dynasty.",
