  "text": "This head belongs stylistically to the latter part of the reign of Jayavarman VII (1181-1219), a devout Buddhist, builder of the Bayon and sponsor of numerous sculptures. A new style was developed during his reign based on less stylized more naturalistic physiognomies distinquished by faint smiles, closed eyes, and hair rendered like a tight fitting cap with a lotiform chignon.",
