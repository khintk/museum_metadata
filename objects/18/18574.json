  "text": "These remarkable sliding screens of Chinese Daoist immortals once decorated the abbot's quarters of the Tenshō-in, a temple within the Zen monastery of Myōshinji in Kyoto. The Chinese believed certain sages, through their moral virtue, faith and discipline, managed to transcend the bounds of the natural world and live forever. They became paragons of self-cultivation and moral behavior and were worshiped as divine saints. Japan's military rulers and high Zen priests who exalted Chinese culture admired such themes. The figures, attired in strange costumes and positioned in a Chinese garden setting, helped create an exotic, unworldly atmosphere within the elegantly appointed context of an audience hall.",
