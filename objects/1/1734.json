  "text": "These angels (its companion hangs to the right) hold symbols of the Passion - the events associated with Jesus Christ's suffering and death. This angel carries the tablet inscribed \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews\" in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, which was placed on the cross, above Jesusâ€™s head. The paintings belong to a series of twelve angels carrying symbols of Christ's Passion, which were painted for a private patron in Rome, Ascanio Filomarino, later appointed a cardinal of the Church and archbishop of Naples. \r\n\r\nFrom 1612 to 1627 Vouet worked in Rome, mainly on religious commissions. These angels were among the last he painted there, completed just months before his return to France. In Paris he helped introduce the Baroque style to French artists: great drama; rich, deep color; and intense light and dark shadows.\r\n\r\n",
