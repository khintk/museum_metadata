  "text": "Erminia and the Shepherds illustrates a scene from one of the great epic poems in the Italian language, <I>Jerusalem Delivered</I>, by Torquato Tasso (1544-95), published in 1581. Guercino's masterpiece is a literal interpretation of stanzas 6 and 7 from the seventh canto of the poem:\r\n<I>\r\nShe rose; and gently, guided by her ear\r\nCame where an old man on a rising ground\r\nIn the fresh shade, his white flocks feeding near,\r\nTwin-baskets wove, and listened to the sound\r\nTrilled by three blooming boys, who sate disporting round.\r\n\r\nThey at the shining of her silver arms,\r\nWere seized at once with wonder and despair,\r\nBut sweet Erminia soothed their vain alarms,\r\nDiscovering her dove's eyes, and golden hair.\r\n</I>\r\n\r\nThis painting underwent an extensive and complex restoration during the fall of 2004. The ten-week long process was fully documented through text, video, and photography, and can be viewed in the interactive computer program located next to this gallery.",
