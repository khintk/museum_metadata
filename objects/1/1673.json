  "text": "Canaletto’s hometown of Venice was his lifelong muse. He made at least three versions of this view of the Grand Canal, a vista you can see (approximately) from the present-day train station. Fastidiously recording every window, door, and chimney along the thoroughfare, Canaletto starts at left with the neighborhood of Cannaregio, with Palazzo Flangini in the foreground and Campo San Marcuola and Palazzo Vendramin Calergi in the distance, at the canal’s bend. On the shady right side are the palaces along the Riva de Biasio, a rare walkway on the Grand Canal.\r\n\r\nCanaletto captured the special qualities of this miraculous city on water -- the stately architecture, the shimmering light, and, in the scattered figures and gondolas, the routine of daily life. The near photographic precision of his paintings made them especially popular with tourists, who bought them as mementoes of their travels to Italy.",
