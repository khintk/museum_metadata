  "text": "瀬戸 Seto ware; Potters active in Seto and Mino, near modern-day Nagoya, produced tea caddies in great number in imitation of imported Chinese examples. By the sixteenth century, however, Japanese potters began to stray from accepted Chinese forms. While this caddy still reflects the overall katatsuki (straight shoulder) style, the gentle undulation of the surface more readily suggests the potter's touch, in contrast to more precisely geometric Chinese examples.",
