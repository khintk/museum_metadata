  "inscription": "(The British man Mr. Wedgewood lost his leg from his childhood disease. When he was grown up, he noticed that most British pots were poorly made. He was determined to create pottery of good quality in Britain. After long and hard work, he finally established his own way to make them. The Wedgewood pottery brought a huge wealth to Britain. It is believed that his disability made him a great art creator.)\r\n\r\n{Eikoku no Wedgewood wa, osanaki toki yamai wo ete fugu to marishi ga, sono kuni no tōki no so naru wo urei, sūnen kufū shite, seikō no shina wo tsukuri dashi, kuni no taieki wo naseri.
