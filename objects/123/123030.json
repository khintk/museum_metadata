  "text": "In East Asia, large and voluptuous plum trees are imagined to resemble a lying dragon–and they are especially attention-grabbing when in full bloom. Funada achieved the richness and density of the thousands of plum blossoms by adding layers upon layers of paint continuously on the same work for years until he felt it to be complete. Photographs and sketches he took in the mountains were the inspiration for these paintings.\r\nFunada was born in Hiroshima and studied oil painting. In the late 1930s, he became a representative of avant-garde Japanese painting and participated in exhibitions of the experimental Rekitei Art Association, whose members were influenced by Surrealism and Abstractionism. After the end of WWII, Funada lived in seclusion in Hiroshima and refused to participate in nation-wide exhibitions.",
