In the meantime, they were given a copy so they did not need Mr. Leslie's copy. He therefore gave $1000 to Princeton to go toward a student center. . .\"a project Jim '52 was promoting.\"\r\n\r\n[This information was taken from a statement by Mr. Leslie in a document entitled \"Exhibit A\". A copy of this document is in the Leslie family file in the Prints and Drawings department, as well in the MIA library.]\r\n\r\n",
