  "text": "Kim Beck’s trompe l’oeil billboard looks so “real” that a visitor to the museum may question its placement. A second and closer look will reveal that this out-of-place sign lacks real dimension and is in fact a visual illusion, a trompe l’oeil (which literally means to “trick the eye”) art object.\r\nToday billboards are considered a visual blight by many, scorned for their transformation of a public space into a commercial one. But, for many others, the billboard is viewed as a nostalgic object, a poignant remnant of the industrial landscape of a bygone era. The artist has transformed this mundane object into a theatrical piece of sculpture, hovering between abstraction and reality, presented for our delectation as an aesthetic or formal structure, which many may find has an intrinsic beauty of its own.\r\n\r\nKim Beck’s trompe l’oeil billboard looks so “real” that a visitor to the museum may question its placement. A second and closer look will reveal that this out-of-place sign lacks real dimension and is in fact a visual illusion, a trompe l’oeil (which literally means to “trick the eye”) art object.\r\nBeck's empty billboard is like a mute facade, a piece of theater scenery, empty of advertising as if the world has run out of messages. it is a sign without a sign. it has been said to reference the recent economic recession. At the same time, it harks back to any number of paintings, photographs and films from the early 20th century that celebrated by the billboard as a dynamic new element in the urban environment.\r\nToday, the billboard is considered a visual blight by many, scorned for its transformation of a public space into a commercial one.
