  "text": "A bodhisattva is an enlightened being who has delayed entering paradise in order to help others attain enlightenment. This figure represents the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, known to the Chinese as Guanshiyin (later also as Guanyin), which means “he who observes the sounds of the world”—including cries for help. In China, Guanyin is widely worshipped as a “goddess of mercy and compassion,” a savior in both the physical and spiritual sense. In popular folklore, reciting the bodhisattva’s name during disaster would bring relief. \r\n\r\nSeated in the lotus position, this figure wears the silk garments and gold jewelry befitting a bodhisattva. The elaborate hairstyle was originally encased by a gilt metal crown, now missing. The gesture of both hands turned up with thumbs touching the middle fingers is perhaps that of discourse or argumentation. Carved during the last creative epoch of Chinese Buddhist sculpture, it expresses the new humanism of the day as well as the gentle, benign calm of near enlightenment.",
