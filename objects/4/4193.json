  "text": "Matisse used a very spare outline technique in his ink drawings, and they are often more probing than pretty. Though capable of dashing off images of astonishing grace, he did not do so here. These lines are fluent but not facile. In his mind they were conscious and full of intent. As he had told his students many years earlier, “One must always search for the desire of the line, where it wishes to enter or where to die away.” In Woman with Still Life, the lines often quaver, inviting us and guiding us into the artist’s heart.",
