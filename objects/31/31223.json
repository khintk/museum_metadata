  "text": "This sandstone plaque makes impressive use of perspective, overlapping figures, and high-relief carving to create a sense of volume and space. It shows episodes from the life of the Buddha and was probably one of a series of relief carvings originally built into the walls of a Buddhist structure. In what appears to be a benediction scene, the Buddha is seated on a throne under a Bodhi tree flanked by two bodhisattvas and his first disciple, Ananda (left), and another disciple, Kasyapa (right). The Buddha is blessing a bodhisattva or acolyte who is kneeling in front of him with hands clasped in worship. To the right of this group stands an armor-clad <I>lokapala</I> (guardian) and two other guardian spirits.",
