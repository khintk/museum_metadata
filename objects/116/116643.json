  "text": "Murata Yoshihiko creates his small and delicate silhouettes from maple wood. Receiving inspiration from nature, he says: “I simulate three-dimensional shapes in my mind, for example, how lines will be flowing or how they are placed on pedestals or attached to walls. I believe that only lines that look beautiful from any angle can make a lithe and sharp silhouette.”",
