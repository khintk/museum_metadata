  "text": "According to the Bible (Genesis 1: 6-8), on the second day of the Creation of the World, God separates the “the waters from the waters.” According to Genesis “God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome from the waters that were above the dome… God called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.” The “waters under the dome” are here represented by an old bearded man pouring water from a large amphora, a figure typically used to embody rivers since Roman antiquity. To extend his representative role to oceans and seas, Goltzius crowned him with a rich garland of seashells.",
