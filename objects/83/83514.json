  "text": "This painting depicts celestial Buddha Vairocana seated on a lotus-flower throne in heaven. A jeweled canopy floats above the Buddhaâ€™s head, and he is flanked by heavenly musicians. In front and on either side are his two principal attending deities, Manjusri on a lion and Samantabhadra on a six-tusked elephant. These are the bodhisattvas of wisdom and benevolence. A bodhisattva is a being that is able to reach enlightenment but delays doing so to help suffering beings on earth. The trinity is known in China as Three Saints of Huayan and comes from the influential Mahayana sutras (Buddhist scriptures).",
