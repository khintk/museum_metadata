  "text": "Traveling Japanese Zen monks returned to their country bearing many prized objects from Song-dynasty (960–1279) China, including artworks like this tea caddy. Small, finely crafted containers originally created to store spices and medicines, tea caddies were used by the Japanese to hold powdered tea in the tea ceremony. Tea caddies and other tea utensils were oftentimes handed down with assorted boxes, silk wrappings, and documentation. Sometimes these items were treasured alongside the object itself, because they were associated with a previous owner. An earlier owner assigned this caddy a poetic name that remains with it today: Tamamizu, or “Drop of Water.” It is inscribed in ink on the caddy’s outer box and in gold on the black lacquer case.",
