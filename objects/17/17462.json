  "text": "The three wall painting fragments you see here were recovered in 1923 from a ruined Chinese temple. The largest image depicts Guan Yin, a bodhisattva, or one who rejected nirvana in order to serve mankind. Kuan-Yin is distinguished by the image of the Dhyani-Buddha on his headdress, and by his intricate clothing and jewels.  The other two paintings represent Guan Yin's attendant Apsaras, or flying angels.\r\n\r\nThese three figures are parts of a larger Buddhist paradise scene, used by devotees for meditation and teaching, which once covered the wall opposite the temple's entrance.  Notice the position ofGuan Yin's hands.  While his right hand rests on his knee, his left palm is raised, presumably towards the composition's principal deity.  \r\n\r\nThe paradise scene was painted directly onto the temple's mud walls, using pigment suspended in a mixture of water and glue. \r\n \r\n",
