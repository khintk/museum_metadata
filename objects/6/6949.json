  "text": "In the 1930s, science fiction magazines, comic strips and film shorts featured the likes of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon all finding an audience receptive to futuristic gadgetry such as teardrop-shaped spaceships, moonwagons, and ray guns.  Later editions became ever more fanciful, inspiring such ingenious devices as this ice gun. Activated by a spring-loaded plunger and trigger mechanism, it is designed to instantly mangle an ice cube \"shooting\" the ice spray through the rubber gasket at the bottom. Little wonder the cocktail hour became so popular.",
