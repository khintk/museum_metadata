  "text": "In the rugged hills southeast of Kyoto, the area of Shigaraki has produced some of Japan’s finest ceramics since the twelfth century. The local clay has little iron, lending Shigaraki wares a peach or reddish-brown color, and includes many particles of feldspar and quartz that rise to the surface during firing, resulting in the kind of pockmarked surface seen on this large storage jar. Coil-formed in four levels and then smoothed, this jar features a natural red-brown glaze—formed in the kiln when wood ash settles on the surface of the pot—that descends unevenly from the shoulder to the foot.",
