  "text": "Designed by Albrecht Dürer's student Hans Schäufelein, this set of roundels depicts five crucial moments from the life of Jesus: the Annunciation of his birth to his mother; his mother Mary praying to him after his birth; the Adoration of the Magi; Christ's Resurrection; and Jesus as the Judge at the Last Judgment. Acquisition of these beautiful panels from the German Renaissance significantly strengthens the Mia’s collection of stained glass.",
