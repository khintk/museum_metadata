  "text": "Two life-sized young women face each other on a rumpled mattress in intimate conversation. Made from cloth bandages dipped in plaster and wrapped around live models, the figures carry a physical and emotional presence. The models for the work were a real life couple including Jill Johnston, the art critic for New York’s Village Voice newspaper. In the 1960s, she was known for her outspoken critique of the era’s dominant cultural trends, her support of gay rights and her openness about her own lesbian identity. The sculpture honors an enduring love that transcends the accepted gender categories of a bygone era: The Girl Friends will forever be frozen together, leaning toward each other in a loving gesture.",
