  "text": "Like many of his fellow surrealists, Hayter frequently enlisted the gods and heroes of Greek mythology as subject matter, as in this eccentric interpretation of the birth of the winged horse Pegasus. According to legend, Pegasus springs forth from the spilled blood of the severed head of Medusa, the Gorgon monster slain by the warrior Perseus. Though veering strongly toward abstraction, Hayter deftly combines dynamic figuration, vigorous line, and vivid color to convey his theme of life emerging from death. Hayter may have been inspired by the work of his assistant Leo Katz, whose earlier interpretation of Pegasus was produced at Atelier 17 (on view in this gallery). ",
