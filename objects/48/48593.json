  "text": "As a printmaker, William Nicholson made his fame in woodcuts. This was his first lithograph, one of very few he ever made. He probably spied this barge horse along the canal towpath in the village of Denham, Buckinghamshire, where he lived in 1894. His restraint testifies to the admiring comment made by artist James McNeill Whistler in 1900, which is that Nicholson understood the \"art of leaving out.\" ",
