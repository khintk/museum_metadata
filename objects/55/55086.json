  "text": "The itinerant tradesman in this print wonderfully resembles the vermin that he is paid to kill. He is a picture of fur, from his furry chin to his scruffy fur cloak. What's more, the little rat on his shoulder forms a curved counterpoint to his bulbous hat. His wares are many and his methods effective, as the dangling dead rats would lead us to believe. He hands rat poison to the repulsed homeowner while his assistant holds a cage for rat-killing ferrets. In Rembrandt's day the Dutch were unaware that rats helped spread the plague, and in 1655 Amsterdam would lose 10 percent of its population to the epidemic.",
